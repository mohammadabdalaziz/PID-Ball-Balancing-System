# PID-Ball-Balancing-System

This project uses an Arduino-controlled system with a servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and potentiometers to create a ball-balancing mechanism. The goal is to maintain the ball's position on a track by adjusting its angle. The ultrasonic sensor monitors the ballâ€™s location, and a PID controller provides corrective adjustments via the servo motor, ensuring stability. This project provides hands-on experience in embedded systems, control theory, and practical implementation.
